## 🎓 Graduation Project

**Title:** *Optimization of Tropical Cyclone Dynamic Detection and Area Estimation Algorithm Based on DynamiCyclone-YOLO*  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Jingwen Li  
**Period:** 2024.12 – 2025.5

This project aims to optimize a deep learning-based method for detecting and measuring tropical cyclones in satellite infrared imagery.  
It introduces an improved version of the YOLOv8 framework, named **DynamiCyclone-YOLO**, which is specially tailored for:

- Accurate detection of small-scale cyclone features  
- Dynamic tracking of storm evolution over time  
- Reliable area estimation of cyclone cloud clusters under changing environmental conditions

The work includes dataset construction from FY-series satellites, model development and training, and performance validation using real-world typhoon cases.
