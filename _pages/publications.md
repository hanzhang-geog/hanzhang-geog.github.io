**Abstract:**  
This study proposes a three-scale (region, block, plot) and three-dimensional (scale, agglomeration, spatial form) framework to analyze the spatial distribution of rural residential areas in Changxing County. A U-net neural network model is employed to extract boundaries of settlement from UAV imagery. The results indicate:
- At the regional scale: land use is intensive and close to policy minimums;
- At the block scale: significant “hotspot” clustering characteristics are observed;
- At the plot scale: settlements are mainly strip-like, scattered, and block-shaped with regular forms.  
This multi-scale approach offers scientific support for urbanization and rural planning in plain areas.

**Keywords:** rural areas; residential area; spatial characteristic; multi-scale analysis; multi-dimension analysis

### 2. Priority Options for the 17 UN Sustainable Development Strategies — Based on the Model Network Perspective  
**Published in:** *Business & Management – EMEHSS*, Vol.49, 2023  
**Authors:** Yaqi You, Yuwen Yang, **Han Zhang**

**Abstract:**  
To enhance the implementation efficiency of the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), this study constructs a priority framework based on model coupling. Using grey relational analysis (GRA), ISM (Interpretative Structural Modeling), DEMATEL, and grey forecasting with multiple linear regression, it identifies high-priority goals such as “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure,” “Good Health,” and “No Poverty.”  
The proposed model also tests priority levels under COVID-19 scenarios, confirming robustness and practical significance for SDG policy-making in China and globally.

**Keywords:** Grey Relational Analysis, Interpretative Structural Modeling, Dematel model, Multiple linear regression.
