## 📚 Research Experience  

**Undergraduate Thesis**    
*Dynamic Detection and Area Estimation of Tropical Cyclones Based on DynamiCyclone-YOLO*  
2024.12 – Present | Supervisor: Prof. Jingwen Li    
- Developed an improved YOLOv8-based model for detecting tropical cyclones in infrared remote sensing images  
- Built multi-year infrared dataset using National Institute of Informatics imagery (2000–2024)  
- Focused on enhancing model sensitivity to small-scale features and dynamic storm regions  

**Estimation of daytime all-sky sea surface temperature from Himawari-8
 based on multilayer stacking machine learning**
 Project Team Leader
 11/2023– 12/2023
 Supervisor: Donglin Fan (Associate Professor)
 - Designed a three-layer stacked machine learning model (TLSM) with 22-dimensional input features and
 evaluated its performance using R², RMSE, and bias.
 - Constructed a training and testing sample set covering nine cloud types by matching Himawari-8 gridded
 imagery with cloud property products and in situ sea surface temperature (SST) data through three-level
 collocation in time, space, and quality flags.
 - Conducted multiple comparative experiments—such as SVR baseline model comparisons, cloud-type-specific
 evaluations, input configuration tests, and additional comparative studies—to achieve all-weather sea surface
temperature retrieval.
